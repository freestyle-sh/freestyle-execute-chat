## 🔍 Vision

Freestyle Execute Chat represents a new vision for AI assistants - one where they don't just talk about doing things, but can actually take action on your behalf. Unlike traditional chatbots that are limited to conversation, this assistant can:

- Execute code to solve problems in real-time
- Connect to your services and tools through extensible modules
- Perform complex workflows spanning multiple systems
- Adapt to your specific needs through customization

The core philosophy is simple: **an assistant should assist**, not just converse. By giving our AI the ability to execute code and interact with external systems, we bridge the gap between conversation and action.

Freestyle Chat is a jack of all trades master of none chat assistant. We believe their is an incredible opportunity for people (like you), to fork it, focus on a single vertical, and master them. We encourage you to steal our code and make it your own and we're here to help you do that.

## ✨ Key Capabilities

- 💻 **Real Code Execution** - The assistant can write and run code directly in the chat to process data, create visualizations, or solve computational problems
- 🧩 **Extensible Module System** - Connect the assistant to the tools you use every day through our module system
- 📊 **Structured Data Collection** - Request and validate specific information from users in structured formats
- 🔒 **Security-Focused Design** - Careful permission boundaries protect your data and systems
- 🎨 **Customizable UI** - Adapt the interface to your preferences with theming options
